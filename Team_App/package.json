  "description": "- `console.log(<HeadingComponent />)` in this the `<HeadingComponent />` is used to call the functional component `HeadingComponent`. \r - The above is similar to `console.log(HeadingComponent())` , behind the scene they render the same object by executing the function.\r - passing props to a function is similar to passing arguments to a function.\r - Everything you see repeating in an app is made using component.\r - We need to build just one component and use it in iteration for any number of times needed.\r -",
